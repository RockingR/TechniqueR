> R’s subsetting operators are powerful and fast. 

> Mastery of subsetting allows you to succinctly express complex operations in a way that few other languages can match. 

> Subsetting is hard to learn because you need to master a number of interrelated concepts:   
• The three subsetting operators.  
• The six types of subsetting.  
• Important differences in behaviour for different objects (e.g., vectors, lists, factors, matrices, and data frames).  
• The use of subsetting in conjunction with assignment.  

> the simplest type of subsetting: subsetting an atomic vector with [. 

> then first to more complicated data types (like arrays and lists), and then to the other subsetting operators, [[ and $. 

> how subsetting and assignment can be combined to modify parts of an object, you’ll see a large number of useful applications.

> `str()` shows you **the structure of any object**, and `subsetting` allows you to **pull out the pieces** that you’re interested in.

### **quizz**
> 1. What is the result of subsetting a vector with positive integers, negative integers, a logical vector, or a character vector?

> 2. What’s the difference between [, [[, and $ when applied to a list?

> 3. When should you use drop = FALSE?

> 4. If x is a matrix, what does x[] <- 0 do? How is it different to x <- 0?

> 5. How can you use a named vector to relabel categorical variables?

### **Outline**

> teaching you about [.   

> learning the six types of data that you can use to subset atomic vectors. 

> six data types act when used to subset lists, matrices, data frames, and S3 objects.

> subsetting operators to include [[ and $, focussing on the important principles of simplifying vs. preserving

> learn the art of subassignment, combining subsetting and assignment to modify parts of an object.

> eight important, but not obvious, applications of subsetting to solve problems in a data analysis.


### **Data types**  

```{r}
x <- c(2.1, 4.2, 3.3, 5.4)
```


> There are **five things that you can use to subset a vector**:

> `Positive integers` return elements at the `specified positions`:

```{r}

x[c(3, 1)]
x[order(x)]
x[c(1, 1)]
x[c(2.1, 2.9)]

```

> `Negative integers` omit elements at the specified positions:

```{r}

x[-c(3, 1)]
```


> You `can’t mix positive and negative` integers in a single subset:

```
x[c(-1, 2)] # won't work
```

> `Logical vectors` select elements where the corresponding logical value is `TRUE`. 

> This is probably the most useful type of subsetting because you write the expression that creates the logical vector:

```{r}
x[c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)]

x[x > 3]
```


> If the logical vector is `shorter` than the vector being subsetted, it will be `recycled` to be the same length.

```{r}
x[c(TRUE, FALSE)]
x[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)]
```

> A `missing value` in the `index` always yields a missing value in the output:

```{r}

x[c(TRUE, TRUE, NA, FALSE)]
```

> `Nothing` returns the original vector.   
- This is not useful for vectors but is very useful for matrices, data frames, and arrays.   
- It can also be useful in conjunction with assignment.  

```{r}

x[]
```

> `Zero` returns a `zero-length vector`.   
- This is not something you usually do on purpose     
- but it can be helpful for generating test data.    

```{r}

x[0]
```

> If the vector is named, you can also use:  
- Character vectors to return elements with matching names.  

```{r}

y <- setNames(x, letters[1: 4])
y
y[c("d", "c", "a")]

# Like integer indices, you can repeat indices
y[c("a", "a", "a")]

# When subsetting with [ names are always matched exactly
z <- c(abc = 1, def = 2)
z[c("a", "d")]
```

## **Lists**  

> Subsetting a list works in the same way as subsetting an atomic vector.   

> Using `[` will always return a list; 

> `[[ and $`, as described below, let you pull out the components of the list.

###  **Matrices and arrays**  

> You can subset higher-dimensional structures in three ways:  
• With multiple vectors.  
• With a single vector.  
• With a matrix.  


> The most common way of subsetting matrices (2d) and arrays (>2d): you supply a 1d index for each dimension, separated by a comma. 

> Blank subsetting is now useful because it lets you keep all rows or all columns.

```{r}

a <- matrix(1: 9, nrow = 3)
a
colnames(a) <- c("A", "B", "C")
a[1:2, ]
a[c(T, F, T), c("B", "A")]
a[0, -2]
```


> By default, [ will simplify the results to the lowest possible dimensionality. 

> Because matrices and arrays are implemented as vectors with special attributes, you can subset them with a single vector. 

> In that case, they will behave like a vector. Arrays in R are stored in column-major order:

```{r}
outer  # scientific mind practice
vals <- outer(1: 5, 1: 5, FUN = "paste", sep = ",")
vals[c(4, 15)]
```


> You can also subset higher-dimensional data structures with an integer
matrix (or, if named, a character matrix).

> Each row in the matrix specifies the location of one value, where each column corresponds to a
dimension in the array being subsetted. 

> This means that you use a 2 column matrix to subset a matrix, a 3 column matrix to subset a 3d array, and so on. 

> The result is a vector of values:

```{r}

vals <- outer(1: 5, 1: 5, FUN = "paste", sep = ",")
vals
select <- matrix(ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE, c(
                                                  1, 1,
                                                  3, 1,
                                                  2, 4
))
select
vals[select]

```

### **Data frames**  

> Data frames possess the `characteristics of both lists and matrices`:


```{r}

df <- data.frame(x = 1: 3, y = 3: 1, z = letters[1: 3])
df[df$x == 2, ] #  


df[c(1, 3), ]
```



> if you `subset with a single vector`, they behave like lists; 

> if you `subset with two vectors`, they behave like matrices.

```{r}

# Like a list:
df[c("x", "z")]
str(df[c("x", "z")])
typeof(df[c("x", "z")])

# Like a matrix
df[, c("x", "z")]
str(df[, c("x", "z")])
typeof(df[, c("x", "z")])
```

>  There's an important difference if you select a single column: matrix subsetting simplifies by default, list subsetting does not.


```{r}
df["x"]
str(df["x"])
typeof(df["x"])
df[, "x"]
str(df[, "x"])
typeof(df[, "x"])
```


### **S3 objects** 

> `S3 objects` are made up of atomic vectors, arrays, and lists

> so you can always `pull apart` an `S3 object` using the techniques described above and the knowledge you gain from `str()`.

### **S4 objects**  

> There are also `two additional subsetting operators` that are needed for `S4 objects`: `@` (equivalent to `$`), and `slot()` (equivalent to `[[`). 

> `@` is more restrictive than `$` in that it will return an error if the `slot` does not exist.



### **Exercises**  

> 1. Fix each of the following common data frame subsetting errors:

```{r}
mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 4, ]
mtcars[1: 4, ]
mtcars[mtcars$cyl < 5 | mtcars$cyl == 5, ] # it is not working
mtcars[!mtcars$cyl > 5, ]
mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 4 || mtcars$cyl == 6, ] # || produces it includes cyl ==8
mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 4 | mtcars$cyl == 6, ]  # | is right, || is wrong
```

> 2. Why does x <- 1:5; x[NA] yield five missing values? (Hint: why is it different from x[NA_real_]?)

```{r}

x <- 1:5
x[NA] # NA is logical, to be tested by all element
x[NA_real_] # NA_real_ is numeric, specific position
typeof(NA)
typeof(NA_real_)
```


> 3. What does upper.tri() return? How does subsetting a matrix with it work? Do we need any additional subsetting rules to describe its behaviour?

```{r}
x <- outer(1: 5, 1: 5, FUN = "*")
x
upper.tri(x)  # return a matrix of F and T
x[upper.tri(x)] # return a vector, not a matrix
x[1:4] # due to its 2d atomic vector, [1:4] is working
typeof(x) # double, atomic vector, not a list
class(x) # matrix, not dataframe
str(x) # num 

m2 <- matrix(1:20, 4, 5)
lower.tri(m2)           # not know why the number of F and T
m2[lower.tri(m2)] <- NA
m2
```


> 4. Why does mtcars[1:20] return a error? How does it differ from the similar mtcars[1:20, ]?

```{r}
typeof(mtcars) # list
class(mtcars) # data frame
str(mtcars) # 
# mtcars[1:20] # same below
# mtcars[c(1:20)] # wrong, "undefined column selected", not [1:4], has to specify columns
mtcars[1:20, ]
```

> 5. Implement your own function that extracts the diagonal entries from a matrix (it should behave like diag(x) where x is a matrix).

```{r}
require(stats)
dim(diag(3))
diag(10, 3, 4) # guess what?
```


> 6. What does df[is.na(df)] <- 0 do? How does it work?

```{r}
df
is.na(df)
df[is.na(df)] <- 0 # nothing (F) is assigned to be 0
df
```

## **Subsetting operators**  

> There are two other subsetting operators: [[ and $. 

> [[ is similar to [, except it can only return a single value and it allows you to pull pieces
out of a list. 

> $ is a useful shorthand for [[ combined with character subsetting.

> You need [[ when working with lists. This is because when [ is applied to a list it always returns **a list**: it never gives you the **contents of the list**. 

> To get the contents, you need [[: “If list x is a train carrying objects, then **`x[[5]]` is the object in car5**; `x[4:6]` is a train of cars 4-6.” — @RLangTip Because it can return only a single value, you must use [[ with either a single positive integer or a string

```{r}

x <- list(1, 2, 3, c("a", "c"), c(F, T), list(F,T))
x[[5]] # return the vector of F and T
x[4:6] # return a list include the 4th, 5th, 6th
```



```{r}

a <- list(a = 1, b = 2)
a
a[[1]]
a[["a"]]
# If you do supply a vector it indexes recursively
b <- list(a = list(b = list(c = list(d = 1))))
b
b[["a"]]
b[[c("a","b")]]
b[[c("a", "b", "c", "d")]]
# Same as
b[["a"]][["b"]]
typeof(b[["a"]][["b"]])
b[["a"]][["b"]][["c"]][["d"]]
typeof(b[["a"]][["b"]][["c"]][["d"]])
```

> Because data frames are lists of columns, you can use `[[` to extract a column from data frames: 

```{r}
str(mtcars)
mtcars[[1]] # vector
typeof(mtcars[[1]]) # prove it
mtcars[["cyl"]]
typeof(mtcars[["cyl"]])
```

> `S3 and S4 objects` can `override` the standard behaviour of `[ and [[` so they **behave differently for different types of objects**. 

> The key difference is usually how you select between `simplifying or preserving behaviours`, and what the default is

## **Simplifying vs. preserving subsetting**  

> It’s important to understand the distinction between simplifying and preserving subsetting. 

> Simplifying subsets returns the simplest possible data structure that can represent the output, and is useful interactively because it usually gives you what you want. 

> Preserving subsetting keeps the structure of the output the same as the input, and is generally better for programming because the result will always be the same type. 

> `Omitting drop = FALSE` when subsetting matrices and data frames is one of the most common sources of programming errors.

> (It will work for your test cases, but then someone will pass in a single column data frame and it will fail in an unexpected and unclear way.)

> Unfortunately, how you switch between simplifying and preserving differs for different data types, as summarised in the table below.

> **Subsetting**: ![](subset.png)

> Preserving is the same for all data types: you get the same type of output as input. 

> Simplifying behaviour varies slightly between different data types, as described below:

> Atomic vector: removes names.

```{r}

x <- c(a = 1, b = 2)
x[1]

x[[1]]
```


> List: return the object inside the list, not a single element list.

```{r}

y <- list(a = 1, b = 2)
str(y[1])

str(y[[1]])
```

> Factor: drops any unused levels.

```{r}

z <- factor(c("a", "b"))
z[1]
z[1, drop = TRUE]

```

> Matrix or array: if any of the dimensions has length 1, drops that dimension.

```{r}

a <- matrix(1: 4, nrow = 2)
a[1, , drop = FALSE]

a[1, ]
```


> Data frame: if output is a single column, returns a vector instead of a data frame.

```{r}

df <- data.frame(a = 1: 2, b = 1: 2)
str(df[1])

str(df[[1]])

str(df[, "a", drop = FALSE])

str(df[, "a"])
```

## `$`  


> `$` is a shorthand operator, where `x$y` is equivalent to `x[["y", exact = FALSE]]`. 

> It’s often used to access variables in a data frame, as in `mtcars$cyl` or `diamonds$carat`.

> One common mistake with `$` is to try and use it when you have the name of a column stored in a variable:

```{r}

var <- "cyl"
# Doesn't work - mtcars$var translated to mtcars[["var"]]
mtcars$var

# Instead use [[
mtcars[[var]]
```


> There’s one important difference between `$ and [[`. `$` does `partial matching`:

```{r}

x <- list(abc = 1)
x$a
x[["a"]]
```


> If you want to avoid this behaviour you can set the **global option** `warnPartialMatchDollar` to `TRUE`. Use with caution: it may affect behaviour in other code you have loaded (e.g., from a package).


### **Missing/out of bounds indices**  

> `[ and [[` differ slightly in their behaviour when the index is `out of bounds (OOB)`, 

> for example, when you try to extract the fifth element of a length four vector, or subset a vector with NA or NULL:

```{r}

x <- 1: 4
str(x[5])
str(x[NA_real_])
str(x[NULL])
```

> The following table summarises the results of subsetting atomic vectors and lists with [ and [[ and different types of OOB value.

> **Difference between atomic and list**: ![](OOB.png)

> If the input vector is named, then the names of OOB, missing, or NULL components will be "<NA>".

### **Exercises** 
> 1. Given a linear model, e.g., mod <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars), extract the residual degrees of freedom. Extract the R squared from the model summary (summary(mod))

```{r}

mod <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
summary(mod)
str(summary(mod))
summary(mod)$r.squared
```

## **Subsetting and assignment**  

> All subsetting operators can be combined with assignment to modify selected values of the input vector.

```{r}

x <- 1: 5
x[c(1, 2)] <- 2: 3
x
```


# The length of the LHS needs to match the RHS
```{r}
x[-1] <- 4: 1
x

```

#> [1] 2 4 3 2 1
# Note that there's no checking for duplicate indices
```{r}
x[c(1, 1)]
x[c(1, 1)] <- 2:3
x[c(1, 1)]
x
```

#> [1] 3 4 3 2 1
# You can't combine integer indices with NA
x[c(1, NA)] <- c(1, 2)
#> Error: NAs are not allowed in subscripted assignments
# But you can combine logical indices with NA
# (where they're treated as false).
x[c(T, F, NA)] <- 1
x
#> [1] 1 4 3 1 1
# This is mostly useful when conditionally modifying vectors
df <- data.frame(a = c(1, 10, NA))
df$a[df$a < 5] <- 0
df$a
#> [1] 0 10 NA
