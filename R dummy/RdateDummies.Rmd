# Working with Dates

```{r}

xd <- as.Date("2012-07-27")
xd
str(xd)
weekdays(xd)
xd + 7
xd + 0:6
weekdays(xd + 0:6)
 
startDate <- as.Date("2012-01-01")
xm <- seq(startDate, by="2 months", length.out=6)
xm
 months(xm)
quarters(xm)
```

> The results of many date functions, including weekdays() and months() depends on the locale of the machine you’re working on. The locale describes elements of international customization on a specific installation of R. This includes date formats, language settings, and currency settings. To find out some of the locale settings on your machine, use Sys.localeconv(). R sets the value of these variables at install time by interrogating the operating system for details. You can change these settings at runtime or during the session with Sys.setlocale().

```{r}

Sys.localeconv()

```

> **different time intervals**: ![](Rdate1.png)

> This rather cryptic line of code indicates that the date format consists of the day (%d), full month name (%B), and the year with century (%Y), with spaces between each element.
 
> Table 6-2 lists some of the many date formatting elements that you can use to specify dates. You can access the full list by typing ?strptime in your R console.

```{r}

as.Date("27/July/2012", format="%d/%B/%Y")  # so far anything with character month won't work
as.Date("27/七月/2012", format="%d/%B/%Y")

as.Date("27/07/2012", format="%d/%m/%Y")  
as.Date("27/7/12", format="%d/%m/%y")
 
```

# Adding Time Information to Dates

> **format date and time**: ![](Rdate2.png)

```{r}

apollo <- "七月 20, 1969, 20:17:39"
apollo.fmt <- "%B %d, %Y, %H:%M:%S"
xct <- as.POSIXct(apollo, format=apollo.fmt, tz="UTC")
xct


apollo <- "07/20/1969, 20:17:39"
apollo.fmt <- "%m/%d/%Y, %H:%M:%S"
xct <- as.POSIXct(apollo, format=apollo.fmt, tz="UTC")
xct

format(xct, "%d/%m/%y")
format(xct, "%S minutes past %I %p, on %d %B %Y")
 
```
# Performing Operations on Dates and Times
 
## Addition and subtraction

> **difference between POSIXct and POSIXlt**: ![](Rdate3.png)

> **difference between POSIXct and POSIXlt**: ![](Rdate4.png)


```{r}

24*60*60
xct
xct + 7*86400
xct + 3*60*60
xct - 7*86400
as.Date(xct)
as.Date(xct) - 7

```
 
## Comparison of dates

```{r}

Sys.time()
Sys.time() < xct
 
dec.start <- as.POSIXct("1950-01-01") # turn a string into a date
dec <- seq(dec.start, by="10 years", length.out=4)
dec
dec > xct

```
 
## Extraction

```{r}

xlt <- as.POSIXlt(xct) # turn a POSIXct into a POSIXlt object
xlt
xlt$year
xlt$mon
unclass(xlt)
class(unclass(xlt))
```
