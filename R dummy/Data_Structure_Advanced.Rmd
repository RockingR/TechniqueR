## **R base Data Structure**  

> organized by their dimensions, 1, 2, n

> no 0 dimension = no scalar, but vector of length one in R

> **all data types based on dimension**:  
![](dimension.png) 

> `str()`
- compact, human readable description of any R data structure

```{r}
str
methods(str)
getAnywhere(str.data.frame)
oldClass # dealing with class, S3 and S4, deep for later
invisible # widely used, deep for later, usage: Return a (temporarily) invisible copy of an object.
NextMethod # too deep for later

```

> `NextMethod`  
- R possesses a simple generic function mechanism which can be used for an object oriented style of programming.    
- Method dispatch takes place based on the class(es) of the first argument to the generic function or of the object supplied as an argument to UseMethod or NextMethod.

### 1. What are the three properties of a vector, other than its contents?  

> The three properties of a vector are type, length, and attributes.

### 2. What are the four common types of atomic vectors? What are the two rare types?  

> The four common types of atomic vector are `logical`, `integer`, `double` (sometimes called `numeric`), and `character`.

> The two rarer types are `complex` and `raw`.  

### 3. What are `attributes`? How do you get them and set them?????  

> `Attributes` allow you to associate arbitrary additional metadata to any object. You can get and set individual `attributes`  

> with attr(x, "y") and attr(x, "y") <- value; or get and set all `attributes` at once with `attributes()`.  

### 4. How is a list different from an atomic vector? How is a matrix different from a data frame?  

> The elements of a list can be any type (even a list); the elements of an atomic vector are all of the same type.  

> Similarly, every element of a matrix must be the same type; in a data frame, the different columns can have different types.  

### 5. Can you have a list that is a matrix? Can a data frame have a column that is a matrix?  ????   

> You can make “list-array” by assuming dimensions to a list.  

> You can make a matrix a column of a data frame with `df$x <- matrix()`, 

>  or using `I()` when creating a new data frame `data.frame(x = I(matrix())`.

```{r}
I
structure
match
replace
# attrib
storage.mode

# have a look how many more unknow functions before you can understand 
require(quantstrat)
applyStrategy
```

# **Vectors**  

> The basic data structure in R is the vector. 

> Vectors in two kinds:  
- atomic vectors   
- and lists. 

> Vectors with three properties:  
- `Type`, `typeof()`, what it is    
- `Length`, `length()`, how many elements it contains.  
- `Attributes`, `attributes()`, additional arbitrary metadata.  

```{r}
typeof
length
attributes
```


> `is.vector()`  
- True for a vector with no attributes but names

```{r}
is.vector
```

> `is.atomic(x) || is.list(x)`   
- True for vector, as either atomic vector or list

```{r}
is.atomic
is.list
```



## atomic vectors 

```{r}

dbl_var <- c(1, 2.5, 4.5)
dbl_var
# With the L suffix, you get an integer rather than a double
int_var <- c(1L, 6L, 10L)
int_var
# Use TRUE and FALSE (or T and F) to create logical vectors
log_var <- c(TRUE, FALSE, T, F)
log_var
chr_var <- c("these are", "some strings")
chr_var

# what nest c() produce is still atomic vector
c(1, c(2, c(3, 4)))

# the same as
c(1, 2, 3, 4)

```

### **NA and types**  

```{r}
c(NA, "a") # NA is coerced into character
typeof(c(NA, "a"))
NA_real_
typeof(NA_real_) # double or numeric
NA_integer_
typeof(NA_integer_)
NA_character_
typeof(NA_character_)

```


###  **Types and tests**  

> `typeof()` return the four types

> `is.character()`, `is.double()`, `is.integer()`, `is.logical()`, `is.atomic()` return TRUE or FALSE   

> TRUE or FALSE is extensively used in if()

```{r}

int_var <- c(1L, 6L, 10L)
int_var
typeof(int_var)

is.integer(int_var)
is.double(int_var)

is.atomic(int_var)
is.list(int_var)

dbl_var <- c(1, 2.5, 4.5)
dbl_var
typeof(dbl_var)
is.double(dbl_var)
is.atomic(dbl_var)
```


> `is.numeric()` is a general test for the “numberliness” of a vector  

> `is.numeric()` returns TRUE for both integer and double vectors

```{r}

is.numeric(int_var)

is.numeric(dbl_var)
```


### **Coercion**  

```{r}

str(c("a", 1)) # numeric coerced into character

x <- c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
as.numeric(x) # logical coerced into numeric

sum(x) # logical coerced into numeric

mean(x)

```

> `+, log, abs, etc` will coerce to a double or integer

> `& | , any, etc` will coerce to a logical. 

> `as.character()`, `as.double()`, `as.integer()`, or `as.logical()` coerce


### **make list**  

> `list()` make list instead of c() making vector  

```{r}

x <- list(1: 3, "a", c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), c(2.3, 5.9))
x
str(x)

```

> Lists are sometimes called `recursive` vectors, because a list can contain other lists

```{r}
x <- list(list(list(list("a", 1, c(1, 2, 3)))))
x
str(x)

is.recursive(x)
```

> `c()` combine lists into one

```{r}

c(list(1, 2), list(3, 4))  
c(list(1, 2, 3, 4))

```

> `c()` coerce atomic vectors into list, given a mixture   

```{r}
x <- list(list(1, 2), c(3, 4))
x  # watch the structure of output carefully
str(x)

y <- c(list(1, 2), c(3, 4))
y
str(y)

```


> `unlist()` Turn list back to atomic vectors

```{r}

x <- list(list(1, 2), c("a", "b"))
x
y <- c(list(1, 2), "a", "b")
y
typeof(x)
is.list(y)
as.list(c(1, 2, 3, 4))
s.list <- as.list(c(1, 2, 3, 4))
unlist(s.list) 
unlist(x) # diff types, coercion rule is applied
unlist(y)
```




> exmaples of complex list   
- not look like list  
- looks like dataframe


```{r}

head(mtcars)
is.list(mtcars)
mod <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
mod
is.list(mod)
```

### **Exercises**  
> 1. What are the six types of atomic vector? How does a list differ from an atomic vector?  

> 2. What makes is.vector() and is.numeric() fundamentally different to is.list() and is.character()?

> 3. Test your knowledge of vector coercion rules by predicting the output of the following uses of c():

```{r}
c(1, FALSE)
c("a", 1)
c(list(1), "a")
c(TRUE, 1L)

```

> 4. Why do you need to use unlist() to convert a list to an atomic vector? Why doesn’t as.vector() work?

> 5. Why is 1 == "1" true? Why is -1 < FALSE true? Why is "one" < 2 false?  
- rule of coercion  

> 6. Why is the default missing value, NA, a logical vector? What’s
special about logical vectors? (Hint: think about c(FALSE,
NA_character_).)

```{r}
c(FALSE, "a")
c(F, 1)
c(F, NA_character_)
c(F, NA)
```


### **Attributes**  

> arbitary metadata of objects

```{r}

y <- 1: 10
attr(y, "my_attribute") <- "This is a vector"
attr(y, "my_attribute")
str(attributes(y))
y
attributes(y)

str(y)
```


>  `structure()` makes vector and attributes at once  

```{r}

structure(1: 10, my_attribute = "This is a vector")
attributes(y[1]) # most attributes are lost when modifying a vector:
attributes(sum(y))
```


### The only attributes not lost are the three most important:

> Names, a character vector giving each element a name,  `names(x)`

> Dimensions, used to turn vectors into matrices and arrays, `dim(x)`

> Class, used to implement the S3 object system, `class(x)`, not `attr(x, "names")`, `attr(x, "class")`, and `attr(x, "dim")`.

### `Names`  

> name a vector in three ways:

```{r}
x <- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3) # 1st way
x 
names(x)


x <- 1:3
names(x) <- c("a", "b", "c")  # 2nd way
x
names(x)

x <- setNames(1:3, c("a", "b", "c"))  # 3rd way
x 
x <- c(a = 1, b = 2, 3)
names(x) # the missing name will be empty
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
names(x)
```

```{r}

x <- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
unname(x)    # directly show vector without name

x <- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
names(x) <- NULL  # get rid of names of elements
x
```

### **Factors**  

> One important use of attributes is to define factors. 

> A factor is a vector of predefined values, to store categorical data. 

> Factors are integer vectors using two attributes `class()` and `levels()`

```{r}

x <- factor(c("a", "b", "b", "a"))
x
str(x)
class(x)
levels(x)
x[2] <- "c" # wrong way of adding new values, has to based on existing levels
x

# NB: you can't combine factors
c(factor("a"), factor("b")) # watch closely what produced
```


> Factors are useful when you know the possible values a variable may
take, even if you don’t see all values in a given dataset.

```{r}

sex_char <- c("m", "m", "m")
sex_factor <- factor(sex_char, levels = c("m", "f"))
sex_factor 
table(sex_char)
table(sex_factor)

```




```{r}
# Reading in "text" instead of from a file here:
z <- read.csv(text = "value\n12\n1\n.\n9")
z
str(z)
class(z)
typeof(z)
z$value
typeof(z$value) # factors are integers
as.double(z$value)
class(z$value) # class is factor
as.double(as.character(z$value))
z <- read.csv(text = "value\n12\n1\n.\n9", na.strings=".")
z
typeof(z$value)
class(z$value) # no longer factor, but integer
z$value

```

> most **data loading functions** in R automatically convert character vectors to factors.

> `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` can do the trick

> While factors look (and often behave) like character vectors, they are actually integers.

> it’s usually best to explicitly convert factors to character vectors if you need string-like behaviour.

### **Exercises**  

> 1. An early draft used this code to illustrate structure():

```{r}

structure(1: 5, comment = "my attribute")
my.attri <- structure(1: 5, comment = "my attribute")
attributes(my.attri)
```


> But when you print that object you don’t see the comment attribute. Why?


> 2. What happens to a factor when you modify its levels?

```{r}
f1 <- factor(letters)
f1
levels(f1) <- rev(levels(f1))
levels(f1)
f1
```

> 3. What does this code do? How do f2 and f3 differ from f1?  

```{r}

f2 <- rev(factor(letters))
f2
f3 <- factor(letters, levels = rev(letters))
f3
```

## **Matrices and arrays**  

> Adding a dim() attribute to an atomic vector allows it to behave like
a multi-dimensional array. 

> A special case of the array is the matrix, which has two dimensions. 

> Matrices are used commonly as part of the mathematical machinery of statistics. 

> Arrays are much rarer, but worth being aware of.

> Matrices and arrays are created with matrix() and array(), or by using the assignment form of dim():

```{r}

# Two scalar arguments to specify rows and columns
a <- matrix(1: 6, ncol = 3, nrow = 2)
a
# One vector argument to describe all dimensions
b <- array(1: 12, c(2, 3, 2))
b
# You can also modify an object in place by setting dim()
c <- 1: 6
dim(c) <- c(3, 2)
c

dim(c) <- c(2, 3)
c
```

> length() generalises nrows() and ncols()  

```{r}
a
length(a)
nrow(a)
ncol(a)
```

> names() generalises to rownames() and colnames() for matrices, and dimnames(), a list of character vectors, for arrays.

```{r}
a
rownames(a) <- c("A", "B")
colnames(a) <- c("a", "b", "c")
a


b
length(b)
dim(b)
dimnames(b) <- list(c("one", "two"), c("a", "b", "c"), c("A", "B"))
b
```

> `c()` generalises to `cbind()` and `rbind()` for matrices

> `abind()` (provided by the abind package) for arrays

> You can transpose a matrix with `t()`; 

> the generalised equivalent for arrays is `aperm()`.

> test if an object is a matrix or array using `is.matrix()` and `is.array()`, or by looking at the length of the `dim()`. 

> `as.matrix()` and `as.array()` make it easy to turn an existing vector into a matrix or array.


> Vectors are not the only 1-dimensional data structure. You can have matrices with a single row or single column, or arrays with a single dimension. 

> They may print similarly, but will behave differently. in case you get strange output from a function (`tapply()` is a frequent offender).

> As always, use `str()` to reveal the differences.

```{r}
1:3
str(1: 3) # 1d vector
matrix(1: 3, ncol = 1)
str(matrix(1: 3, ncol = 1)) # column vector
matrix(1: 3, nrow = 1)
str(matrix(1: 3, nrow = 1)) # row vector
array(1: 3, 3)
str(array(1: 3, 3)) # "array" vector

```


> While atomic vectors are most commonly turned into matrices, the dimension attribute can also be set on lists to make list-matrices or listarrays:

```{r}
array(1:3, c(1, 1, 3))
l <- list(1:3, "a", TRUE, 1.0)
l
dim(l) <- c(1, 1, 4)
l
dim(l) <- c(4, 1)
l
l[1]
l[1, 1]
dim(l) <- c(1, 4)
l
dim(l) <- c(2, 2)
l
l[1,1]
# dim(l) <- c(1, 5) this will produce error

```

> These are relatively esoteric data structures, but can be useful if you want to arrange objects into a grid-like structure. 

> For example, if you’re running models on a spatio-temporal grid, it might be natural to preserve
the grid structure by storing the models in a 3d array


## **Exercises**  
> 1. What does dim() return when applied to a vector?

```{r}

vect2 <- c(1:5)
dim(vect2) <- c(5,1)
dim(vect2)
array1 <- array(1:5, c(1, 5))
array1
dim(array1)
vect1 <- c(1:5)
dim(vect1)
```

> 2. If is.matrix(x) is TRUE, what will is.array(x) return?

```{r}

mat1 <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)
is.matrix(mat1)
is.array(mat1)
```


## **Data frames**  

> A data frame is the most common way of storing data in R, and
if used systematically (http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf)
makes data analysis easier. Under the hood, a data frame is a list of
equal-length vectors. This makes it a 2-dimensional structure, so it
shares properties of both the matrix and the list. This means that a
data frame has names(), colnames(), and rownames(), although names()
and colnames() are the same thing. The length() of a data frame is the
length of the underlying list and so is the same as ncol(); nrow() gives
the number of rows.
As described in Chapter 3, you can subset a data frame like a 1d structure (where it behaves like a list), or a 2d structure (where it behaves
like a matrix).

> 3. How would you describe the following three objects? What makes them different to 1:5?

```{r}

1:5
x1 <- array(1: 5, c(1, 1, 5))
x1
x2 <- array(1: 5, c(1, 5, 1))
x2
x3 <- array(1: 5, c(5, 1, 1))
x3
```
